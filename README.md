# bomb_temperature_anomalies
In this repository, you will find all the necessary tools, code, and data for my participation in the ESA's competition "Little Big Picture".
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Little Picture graphic shows deviations in the average global temperature from 1940 to 2023
(through October) compared to pre-industrial levels (1850-1900). The Earth is symbolized as a bomb,
with deviations represented as a wick burning rapidly, approaching dangerously close to the +1.5Â°C limit
before reaching a point where the bomb ignites. The data used is from the Copernicus ERA-5 dataset.
